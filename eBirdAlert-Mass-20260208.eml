=80=9Ccountable,=E2=80=9D it=E2=80=99s nice to see, especially in February =

All-black bill, sloping from the top of the head to the tip of the bill in =
a straight line (no knob). Dark lores. Tail not pointed up like a mute swan=
. Large swan, very straight neck when it wasn't feeding or resting.

At first, it was sleeping, then feeding, and peacefully coexisting with Can=
ada geese and ducks. After three new Canadas flew in and climbed up onto th=
e ice near the swan, they had an aggressive exchange, looking like they wer=
e hissing at each other (I couldn't actually hear more than honking), and t=
hen the swan went after the geese, chasing them away. Pics."
